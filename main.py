#Write a program to perform the following operations:
#1. Create a tuple of integers
x=("Mihir",45,78.78,False)
print(x)
#2. Create another tuple of integers
y=("Ney York","Long Island","Mumbai")
print(y)
#3. Create a new tuple by adding 9 to the previous tuple
v=y+ (9,)
print(v)
#4. Count the occurrences of an element in a tuple
q=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3234,12321,34212,111)
print(q.count(1))
#5. Perform slicing on tuple
n=(1,12,23,444,565,65,3554,87675,56674,76,764,7)
slice=n[2:4]
print(slice)
